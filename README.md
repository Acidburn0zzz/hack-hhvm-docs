documentation. You'll need PHP v5.3 or greater, and have SQLite installed.

# To update or add documentation

The docs live in `__docs/phpdoc/en`. The `.xml` files and associated 
directories here are basically the top level outline for the documents. 
The key ones are `language` and `reference`.

You will update `.xml` files. See `__docs/phpdoc/doc-base/README` for 
instructions on how to get started. Or just look at the `.xml` files that 
already exist and copy pasta as much as you need to.

If you are adding a new high level topic or extension, you will probably
have to add it to `doc-base/manual.xml.in` as well. `manual.xml` and
`.manual.xml.in` are autogenerated by the validation process below.

# To validate your additions or changes

To make sure all the XML you have changed or added jives (both in legit XML 
and in context with the structure of the documentation), you need to run 
the validator.

The validator is in `__docs/phpdoc/doc-base/configure.php`

To run it:

`php configure.php`

If successful, this will update the `__docs/phpdoc/doc-base/.manual.xml` file 
that is basically all of the `.xml` files squashed together. This file will 
be used to render the `.php` files that will actually serve the site.

If unsuccessful, you will see errors. You can run 

`php configure.php --enable-xml-details` 

for more detailed XML information.


# To render into PHP files

After validation, it is now time to render the docs to be served. Note that 
even if you have not made any changes to the documents, you must run the 
validation step above to generate the `.manual.xml` file.

In `__docs/phd`:

`php render.php -d ../phpdoc/doc-base/.manual.xml -f php -P PHP -o ../../manual/en`

The `.php` files will outputted to the `manual/en` directory.

> To speed up validation, you can try something like:
>   `php render.php -d ../phpdoc/doc-base/.manual.xml -f php -P PHP -o ../../manual/en -t -p language.hack`
> to only render topics that you changed. However, this is not really 
> shippable yet. So before pushing, do a full validation.
> This is good for quick iteration.


# Server up the files locally.

Run a local HHVM server in the root directory, so that `/manual` is a top 
level path. Navigate to `http://<your local sandbox>/manual/en`.


# Scripts to help.
